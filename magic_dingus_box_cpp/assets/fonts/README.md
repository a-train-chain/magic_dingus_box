Zen Dots font placement
=======================

Place the Zen Dots TTF here with the exact filename:

- ZenDots-Regular.ttf

Why this name?
- The native UI will auto-load this file on startup. If it is missing, it falls back to the system-installed Zen Dots (if present) or other fonts.

Where to get it:
- Download from the Google Fonts page for Zen Dots and extract the regular TTF.

After placing the file:
- No config changes needed. Restart the app and the title font will use Zen Dots.
